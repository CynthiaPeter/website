## Introduction

[comment:] <> (What they're learning || What we're building, explain starting point and where we end)  

Validating messages with Kafka involves defining the message schemas using AsyncAPI, and then using those schemas to validate incoming and outgoing messages in your Kafka-based applications. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to validate messages for Kafka. In addition, you'll learn more about EDAs, and the role of Kafka in validating messages.

By the end of this tutorial, you will:

## Installation Guide
	
## Broker-Level Message Validation

## Client-Level Message Validation


## Summary

[comment:] <> ( What did we learn, what we built, and how to apply this to real life.)

By following these steps, you have defined and validated Kafka messages using AsyncAPI, therefore ensuring that the messages conform to the specified schema before processing or sending them, which helps maintain data integrity and consistency in your Kafka-based applications.
