## Introduction

[comment:] <> (What they're learning || What we're building, explain starting point and where we end)  

Validating messages with Kafka involves defining the message schemas using AsyncAPI, and then using those schemas to validate incoming and outgoing messages in your Kafka-based applications. 

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to validate messages for Kafka.

## Background context
	Define a message.
	What is Kafka?
	Why do people use Kafka with AsyncAPI?

## Installation Guide
	
## Broker-Level Message Validation

Integrating message validation with Kafka producers
Validating outgoing messages before sending to Kafka


## Client-Level Message Validation

Integrating message validation with Kafka consumers
Validating incoming messages before processing

## Summary

[comment:] <> ( What did we learn, what we built, and how to apply this to real life.)

By following these steps, you have defined and validated Kafka messages using AsyncAPI, therefore ensuring that the messages conform to the specified schema before processing or sending them, which helps maintain data integrity and consistency in your Kafka-based applications.
