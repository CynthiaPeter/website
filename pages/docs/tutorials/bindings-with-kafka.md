## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how bindings with Kafka works. You will learn how to extend your AsyncAPI document with Protocol-specific information, such as how to use Kafka bindings. You will also learn about server bindings and channel bindings.

## Background Context

**What is Kafka**
Kafka is a messaging system that allows for the efficient handling and processing of data streams. 

**What is binding?**
In the context of Kafka, "bindings" refer to the connections between Kafka and other systems or applications. There are several levels of bindings as described below:

<!---How many levels or types of binding are there exactly and where is the best place to place them in this tutorial?--->

- Server Binding
- Channel binding
- Operation Binding

**How binding works in Kafka**
You must understand some essential parts of the process to understand how binding works. 

Kafka as a messaging system - Think of Kafka as a courier service - A messaging system that handles sending and receiving messages between applications. 

Producers and Consumers - Producers send packages (messages) to the courier service (Kafka), and consumers receive these packages.

Topics: Kafka organizes messages into categories. Just like a courier service, it will group items based on several cases, like how heavy the package is or the arrival date. It’s like having different boxes for different messages.

Bindings: Bindings are relevant when integrating Kafka with other programs or services. A binding is a specific agreement or configuration that governs how an application connects to and interacts with Kafka. It can include information such as:

- Which topics should an application read from or write to?
- How should messages be formatted?
- What are the rules for interacting with various forms of data or messages?

Bindings are vital because they ensure that applications and Kafka can communicate effectively with each other's message formats, protocols, and expectations, ensuring data flows securely and efficiently within a system.

My questions - yet to be answered.
- Is there a needed installation guide for this topic?
- Do I need to build an app to demonstrate this topic? - An AsyncAPI file maybe?
- What kind of thing can i build to ensure that the reader understands and follows through?
- How best do I structure this?
