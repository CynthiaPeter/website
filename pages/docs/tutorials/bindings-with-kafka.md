## Introduction

In this tutorial, you will learn how bindings with Kafka works. You will learn how to extend your AsyncAPI document with Protocol-specific information, such as how to specify kafka topic-specific configurations or how to define kafka message key content.

## Background Context

**What is Kafka**
Kafka is a messaging system that allows for the efficient handling and processing of data streams. 

**What is binding?**
In the context of Kafka, "bindings" refer to the connections between Kafka and other systems or applications. There are several levels of bindings as described below:


- Server Bindings
- Channel Bindings
- Operation Bindings

**How binding works in Kafka**
You must understand some essential parts of the process to understand how binding works. 

Kafka as a messaging system - Think of Kafka as a courier service - A messaging system that handles sending and receiving messages between applications. 

Producers and Consumers - Producers send packages (messages) to the courier service (Kafka), and consumers receive these packages.

Topics: Kafka organizes messages into categories. Just like a courier service, it will group items based on several cases, like how heavy the package is or the arrival date. It’s like having different boxes for different messages.

Bindings: Bindings are relevant when integrating Kafka with other programs or services. A binding is a specific agreement or configuration that governs how an application connects to and interacts with Kafka. It can include information such as:

- Which topics should an application read from or write to?
- How should messages be formatted?
- What are the rules for interacting with various forms of data or messages?

Bindings are important because they indicate how Kafka components are configured.
